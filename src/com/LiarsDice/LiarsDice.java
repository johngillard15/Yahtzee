/*
 * Liar's Dice game flow:
 *
 * play(); loop through rounds until there is only one player left
 * round(); loop through players until an accusation is made
 * turn(); player chooses to bid or accuse, if bid player provides the die value and the amount to bet
 * challenge(Player accuser, Player accused); determine the liar and send them to punishment()
 * punishment(Player liar); dish out punishment (remove die/kick out of game)
 * updateTable(); loop through player list and update the tableDice map; remember to reset after round
 *
 * play game
 * 1. game runs through rounds until there is only one player left
 *
 * round
 * 1. roll everyone's dice
 * 2. loop through players and get bids
 * 3. get bids until a player accuses previous player of lying
 * 4. take them to court -> challenge
 *
 * turn
 * 1. ask player if they would like to bid or accuse
 * 2. if bidding, ask for bid (value and amount)
 * 3. next bids must either bid a higher amount of any value, or the same amount of higher value
 * 4. if accusing, initiate challenge sequence
 *
 * challenge
 * 1. count total occurrences of all face values (in tableDice map)
 * 2. check if player's bid was possible (amount >= all die on table)
 * 3. if bid was matched or exceeded (determined by the tableDice HashMap), mark accuser as liar;
 *  if bid was not possible, mark bidder as liar
 * 4. liars get 1 die removed from their die count (remove an element from dice list in player.cup), or get removed
 * from the game if they only have 1 die at time of punishment (remove that player from player list)
 * 5. if the player list has only 1 element, end the game and declare the winner
