/* Yahtzee game flow:
 *
 * public Yahtzee
 * play(); play for 13 rounds(until last player's scorecard is filled)
 * round(); loop through all players
 * turn(); initial dice roll, player can re-roll 2 more times, pick score to put points
 *
 * public ScoreCard
 * HashMap<String, Integer> scoreSheet; every player will have a scoresheet to keep a tally of their scores
 * calculateScore(Player activePlayer, String scoreKey); takes in the current player and the key to the score they chose
 * getPossibleCombos();
 * showPossibleCombos();
 *
 * -------------------------
 * play game
 * 1. game goes for 13 rounds (until last player's scorecards is filled)
 *
 * round
 * 1. loop through all players
 *
 * turn
 * 1. initial dice roll
 * 2. ask player if they want to re-roll some or all dice (up to 2 times)
 * 3. determine what scores are possible based on current roll and the players scorecard
 * 4. ask player which score they would like to contribute to
 * 5. send player over to calculateScore method along with score selection
 *
 * showing combos
 * 1. print player's scoresheet at start of turn
 * 2. after they have made all rolls, determine what combos are possible with current roll (excluding scores already
 * achieved), maybe put these in a list;
 * 3. initialize combo values to -1 and set to 0 if it was used but not scored
 * 4. chance is always available until used
 *
 * calculating combos
 * upper
 * 1. upper scores (1-6) are the sum of the dice
 * 2. if the sum of all upper values is at least 63, add a bonus of 35 points
 * lower
 * 3. three/four-of-a-kind require 3/4 of the same face, and the score is the total of all dice
 * 4. full house has one pair and 3 of a kind; scores 25 points
 * 5. small straight requires at least 4 consecutive die (1-4, 2-5, 3-6), worth 30 points
 * 6. large straight requires 5 consecutive die (1-5 or 2-6), worth 40 points
 * 7. chance is just the sum of the current roll
 * yahtzee
 * 8. yahtzee is five-of-a-kind, and awards 50 points
 * 9. subsequent Yahtzees (jokers) are awarded 100 points instead of 50;
 *  - if the corresponding upper score is not filled, use the roll to fill that score in addition to the joker bonus
 *  - if any lower score has not been filled, mark it as so along with the joker bonus
 * 0. any rolls that cannot be applied to the available combos are forced to mark one with a 0
